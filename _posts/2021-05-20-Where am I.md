### **Where am I?**

â€‹	This is just an article to reflect on me. When I came to a foreign country, I was alone and was lost in my life. I might be because of some past events that happened in my life. I badly wanted a change in my life.This was when I met the ' **Malayalis** ' here. And it was a relief I met all like-minded people. 

I slept through most of my semester and was kind of not interested in putting much effort into anything. I found that the effort I put in was decent to get marks. 

I had worked on medical image research topics, mainly medical image registration. Now I am working on **Federated Learning** for the summer, I do have a good feeling about this research.

By the way, that's me with peaches!
