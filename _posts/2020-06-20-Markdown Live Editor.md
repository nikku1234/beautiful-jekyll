# GUI for Python Packages

We have all be there, where we need to write the markdown file, while we don't remember the syntax at all, and each time we need to save and file and run it to check whether its working or not. It's frustrating in life, where we don't have time to tinker with markdown syntax. So this application helps to preview the markdown as when we type the document, to understand what is happening to our markdown file.
