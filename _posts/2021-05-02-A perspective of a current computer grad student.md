## A perspective of a current computer grad student

### **Math**

​	This may be an underrated thing, but math matters. Most of the courses require a strong background in math. Otherwise, it will hard to cope with the courses. If you are like me, who played around in their undergrad. You will be reading a lot of books in the first week like me. I had to get my math background strong, all the linear algebra and probability stuff. I would suggest you go through the "**Ed 5, Gilbert Strang - Introduction to Linear Algebra (2016, Wellesley-Cambridge Press)**" this one for the linear algebra, it's a big book, but it helps you clear all your doubts and strengthens your math. For probability, there are tons of websites to get the basics back up, like [statlect](https://www.statlect.com) and also this book **"Probabilistic Machine Learning An Introduction - Kevin P. Murphy"** also helps. It may look like hectic to go through this, but you will understand the concepts way faster once you finish these books.

### **Programming Skills**

​	Try to brush up your programming skills as it would come in handy. Usually, the programming language doesn't matter.

### **Assignments and Projects**

​	You will be bombarded with assignments and projects for all the courses you have enrolled, so make sure you spend every day on the courses, otherwise, you will end up missing deadlines. Each course roughly takes around 10 hours of study time. And academic integrity is an important part. You have to submit your work, no other go. and anyway what's the point of submitting someone else's work?

### **Time Managemen**

​	Time management is one of the most important thing, which goes without saying. If you haven't planned out things, you will mess things up. If you have taken extra work, then its more important, to manage everything. Like if you are working on research alongside, you will not have much time to play around.

### *Learn*

​	It doesn't matter whether you have received a scholarship for your grad studies or if you have taken a education loan to do your graduate studies. Make sure you learn new stuff every day. It helps in the long run.



I will update this post as time goes by, but right now. If you are good on the above things, the graduate studies easy as a breeze and you won't have a hard time at all.
