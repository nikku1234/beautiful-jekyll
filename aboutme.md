**Hi**, I am interested in  _Computer Vision with Deep Learning_. I am an independent Deep Learning Engineer. I am currently working on Medical Images with Deep Learning. I finished my UG from  **PSG TECH**. Broadly curious in applying deep learning models for real-time application. The current projects I am is working is related to **Medical Image Analysis using Deep Learning**, **Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)**. I believe that I am always a student. 


My journey is to **help people** and to **make a difference in the world using my knowledge in deep learning**.

I am happy to collaborate. Drop in a mail, if you think we can collaborate on projects.
